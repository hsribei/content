    <p>
      There’s a lot more D3 can do, but those are the 3 key insights you need
      to understand any example you find in the wild.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Code is split into data and DOM manipulation</li>
      <li>Scales are great and used a lot</li>
      <li>You’re always in control of rendering</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Then you can start using D3’s more advanced features like maps and axes
      and shape generators and geo computations and data loading and
      transitions and user interactions.
    </p>

      There’s a lot. We’re not going to cover it all but you can find those
      advanced features in the docs and the skills you learn here will help you
      get started.
