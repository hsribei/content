<p>Somebody once asked me how to learn D3.js from scratch. I quipped that it took me writing a book to really learn it. Itâ€™s one hell of a library.</p>
<p>Most people donâ€™t go that far. They donâ€™t have to.</p>
<p>You start with a problem, find similar examples, do some copy pasta, tweak until it works and end up with a working visualization you donâ€™t understand. Youâ€™d be surprised how few engineers actually understand how their D3 data visualization works.</p>
<p>Fear not! There are just 3 key concepts you have to grok. Then you can understand every D3 example out there. ðŸ˜±</p>
