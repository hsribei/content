  I’m going to assume you already know how to code and that you’re great
  with JavaScript. Many books have been written to teach the basics of
  JavaScript; this is not one of them.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re struggling with modern JavaScript syntax, I suggest visiting my

  I’m assuming you’ve tried D3 before, or at least heard of it. You don’t
  have to know how D3 works, or understand what the code you copy pasted to
  meet a deadline does. I’ll show you all you need to know.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to learn D3 in depth, there’s plenty of great resources out
  there. For example, the third edition of my first ever book,
  <a
    href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/d3js-4x-data-visualization-third-edition"
    >D3.js 4.x Data Visualization - Third Edition</a
  >. Written by Ændrew Rininsland with some chapters left from yours truly.

  As for React, same deal: I expect you have some idea how to use it, but
  you’ll be fine even if this is your first time looking at React. We’ll go
  through everything you need to know as it’s happening.
</p>
<p>
  All examples in React + D3 use modern JavaScript. That is JavaScript from
  ES6 – ES2015 – and beyond. No special mods, just stuff you get by default
  in all React projects in recent years. Even if some syntax isn’t in the
  standard yet.
</p>
<p>I’m going to explain any new syntax that we use.</p>
