<p>I recommend starting with an idea, a problem. Something you want to build. A dataset you want to play with. A feature you want to add to your app.</p>
<p>That makes it easier. Helps focus your brain. Notice things in this course that help <em>you</em> specifically.</p>
<p>From there, I think you should see how much time you’ve got. The course is designed so you can go over the important stuff in a couple hours. Watch a video, read some text, try some code. See how it feels.</p>
<p>If the best way is a daily practice, 20 minutes after work, 5 minutes on the pooper, do that. If you’re more of a sit down and cram it out kind of person, a nice Sunday afternoon with some coffee will do just fine.</p>
<p>But don’t make it a chore. We’re here to have fun :)</p>
<p>Two suggestions ✌️:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Try</em> the example code. Don’t just copy-paste; type it and execute it. Execute frequently. If something doesn’t fit together, look at the linked Github repositories or solved CodeSandboxes. Each project has one.</li>
<li>If you know something, skip that section. You’re awesome. ❤️</li>
</ol>
<p>React + D3 is based on code samples. They look like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" data-caption="Some code"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="kw">let</span> foo <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&#39;bar&#39;</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">foo <span class="op">+=</span> <span class="st">&#39;more stuff&#39;</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Each code sample starts with a commented out file path. That’s the file you’re editing. Like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" data-caption="Code samples have file paths"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"><span class="co">// ./src/App.js</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" title="3"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="va">App</span> ...</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Commands that you should run in the terminal start with an <code>$</code> symbol, like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm start</code></pre>
