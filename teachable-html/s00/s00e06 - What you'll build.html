<h1 id="the-meat-start">Visualizing data with React and d3.js</h1>
<p>
  Welcome to the main part of React + D3 2018. We’re going to talk a little
  theory, learn some principles, then get our hands dirty with some
  examples. Through this book you’re going to build:

</ul>
<p>Looks random, right? Bear with me. Examples build on each other.</p>
<p>
  The first few examples teach you about static data visualizations and the
  basics of merging React and D3 using two different approaches.
</p>
<p>
  The choropleth and histogram visualizations teach you about interactivity
  and components working together.
</p>
<p>
  You learn about game loop and transition animations through two types of
  bouncing balls. Followed by more complex enter/exit transitions with an
  animated alphabet.
</p>
<p>
  We look at how far we can push React’s performance with a simple particle
  generator and a dancing fractal tree. A billiards game helps us learn
  about complex canvas manipulation.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout these examples, we’re going to use <strong>React 16</strong>,
  compatible with <strong>React 17</strong>, <strong>D3v5</strong>, and
  modern <strong>ES6+</strong> JavaScript syntax. The particle generator
  also uses <strong>Redux</strong> for the game loop and the billiards
  simulation uses MobX. We use <strong>Konva</strong> for complex canvas
  stuff.
</p>
<p>
  That way you can build experience in large portions of the React
  ecosystem so you can choose what you like best.
</p>
<p>
  Don’t worry, if you’re not comfortable with modern JavaScript syntax just
  yet. By the end of this book, you’re gonna love it!
</p>
<p>
  Until then, here’s an interactive cheatsheet:
  <a href="https://es6cheatsheet.com/">es6cheatsheet.com</a>. It uses
  runnable code samples to compare the ES5 way with the ES6 way so you can
  brush up quickly.
</p>
<p>
  To give you a taste of React alternatives, we’ll check out
  <strong>Preact</strong>, <strong>Inferno</strong>, and
  <strong>Vue</strong> in the fractal tree example. They’re component-based
  UI frameworks similar to React. Preact is tiny, Inferno is fast, and Vue
  is about as popular as React.

  Let’s talk about how React and D3 fit together. If there’s just one
  chapter you should read, this is the one. It explains how things work and
  fit together. Takes you from beginning to being able to figure out the
  rest on your own.
</p>
<p>
  Although you should still play with the bigger examples. They’re fun.
