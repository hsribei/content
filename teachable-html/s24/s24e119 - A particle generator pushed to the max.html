<h2 id="canvas-react-redux">A particle generator pushed to 20,000 elements with Canvas</h2>
<p>Our <a href="https://swizec1.teachable.com/courses/react-for-data-visualization/lectures/6906668#animating-react-redux">SVG-based particle generator</a> caps out at a few thousand elements. Animation becomes slow as times between iterations of our game loop increase.</p>
<p>Old elements leave the screen and get pruned faster than we can create new ones. This creates a natural upper limit to how many elements we can push into the page.</p>
<p>We can render many more elements if we take out SVG and use HTML5 Canvas instead. I was able to push the code up to almost 20,000 smoothly animated elements. Then JavaScript became the bottleneck.</p>
<p>Well, I say JavaScript was the bottleneck, but monitor size plays a role too. It goes up to 20,000 on my laptop screen, juuuust grazes 30,000 on my large desktop monitor, and averages about 17,000 on my iPhone 5SE.</p>
<p>Friends with newer laptops got it up to 35,000.</p>
<p>You can see it in action hosted on <a href="http://swizec.github.io/react-particles-experiment/">Github pages</a>.</p>
<p>Weâ€™re keeping most of our existing code. The real changes happen in <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">src/components/index.jsx</code>, where a Konva stage replaces the <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;svg&gt;</code> element, and in <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">src/components/Particles.jsx</code>, where we change what we render. Thereâ€™s a small tweak in the reducer to generate more particles per tick.</p>
<p>You should go into your particle generator directory, install Konva and react-konva, and then make the changes below. Trying things out is better than just reading my code <span class="emoji" data-emoji="wink">ðŸ˜‰</span></p>
<pre data-caption="Install Konva"><code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">$ npm install --save konva react-konva</code></pre>
<p>{aside} react-konva is a thin wrapper on Konva itself. Thereâ€™s no need to think about it as its own thing. For the most part, you can go into the Konva docs, read about something, and it Just Worksâ„¢ in react-konva. {/aside}</p>
