    <p>
      I’m glad you asked. This was a silly example. I devised the experiment
      because at my first React+D3 workshop somebody asked,
      <em
        >“What if we have thousands of datapoints, and we want to animate all
        of them?”</em
      >. I didn’t have a good answer.
    </p>

      Now I do. You put them in Canvas. You drive the animation with a game
      loop. You’re good.

      You can even do it as an overlay. Have an SVG for your graphs and charts,
      overlay with a transparent canvas for your high speed animation.
