      Refactor your components with React Hooks
    </h1>
    <p>
      Hooks launched with great fanfare and community excitement in February
      2019. A whole new way to write React components.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a fundamental change, the React team would say, but a mind shift
      after all. A change in how you think about state, side effects, and
      component structure. You might not like hooks at first. With a little
      practice theyâ€™re going to feel more natural than the component lifecycle
      model youâ€™re used to now.
    </p>
    <p>Hooks exist to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>help you write less code for little bits of logic</li>
      <li>help you move logic out of your components</li>
      <li>help you reuse logic between components</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some say it removes complexity around the
      <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">this</code> keyword in JavaScript
      and Iâ€™m not sure that it does. Yes, thereâ€™s no more
      <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">this</code> because everything is a
      function, thatâ€™s true. But you replace that with passing a lot of
      function arguments around and being careful about function scope.
    </p>
    <p>
      My favorite React Hooks magic trick is that you can and should write your
      own. Reusable or not, a custom hook almost always cleans up your code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh and good news! Hooks are backwards compatible. You can write new stuff
      with hooks and keep your old stuff unchanged. ðŸ‘Œ

      In this section weâ€™re going to look at the core React hooks, talk about
      the most important hook for dataviz, then refactor our big example from
      earlier to use hooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Youâ€™ll need to upgrade React to at least version
      <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">16.8.0</code> to use hooks.
