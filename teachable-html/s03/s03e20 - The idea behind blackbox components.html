      Quickly integrate any D3 code in your React project with Blackbox
      Components
    </h1>
    <p>
      Blackbox components are the quickest way to integrate D3 and React. You
      can think of them as wrappers around D3 visualizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the blackbox approach, you can take any D3 example from the
      internets or your brain, wrap it in a React component, and it Just
      Works™. This is great when you’re in a hurry, but comes with a big
      caveat: You’re letting D3 control some of the DOM.
    </p>
    <p>
      D3 controlling the DOM is <em>okay</em>, but it means React can’t help
      you there. That’s why it’s called a Blackbox – React can’t see inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      No render engine, no tree diffing, no dev tools to inspect what’s going.
      Just a blob of DOM elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay for small components or when you’re prototyping, but I’ve had people
      come to my workshops and say
      <em
        >“We built our whole app with the blackbox approach. It takes a few
        seconds to re-render when you click something. Please help”</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>🤔</p>
    <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>React renders an anchor element</li>
      <li>D3 hijacks it and puts stuff in</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You manually re-render on props and state changes. Throwing away and
      rebuilding the entire DOM subtree on each render. With complex
      visualizations this becomes a huge hit on performance.
    </p>
    <p>Use this technique sparingly.</p>
