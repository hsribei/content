<h1 id="blackbox-components">Quickly integrate any D3 code in your React project with Blackbox Components</h1>
<p>Blackbox components are the quickest way to integrate D3 and React. You can think of them as wrappers around D3 visualizations.</p>
<p>With the blackbox approach, you can take any D3 example from the internets or your brain, wrap it in a React component, and it Just Works™. This is great when you’re in a hurry, but comes with a big caveat: You’re letting D3 control some of the DOM.</p>
<p>D3 controlling the DOM is <em>okay</em>, but it means React can’t help you there. That’s why it’s called a Blackbox – React can’t see inside.</p>
<p>No render engine, no tree diffing, no dev tools to inspect what’s going. Just a blob of DOM elements.</p>
<p>Okay for small components or when you’re prototyping, but I’ve had people come to my workshops and say <em>“We built our whole app with the blackbox approach. It takes a few seconds to re-render when you click something. Please help”</em></p>
<p>:thinking:</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>React renders an anchor element</li>
<li>D3 hijacks it and puts stuff in</li>
</ul>
<p>You manually re-render on props and state changes. Throwing away and rebuilding the entire DOM subtree on each render. With complex visualizations this becomes a huge hit on performance.</p>
<p>Use this technique sparingly.</p>
