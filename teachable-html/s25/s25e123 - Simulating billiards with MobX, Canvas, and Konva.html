      We’re building a small game. You have 11 glass balls – marbles, if you
      will. Grab one, throw it at the others, watch them bounce around. There
      is no score, but it looks cool, and it’s a fun way to explore how Konva
      and React give you interactive Canvas features.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re using React and Konva to render our 11 marbles on an HTML5 Canvas
      element, MobX to drive the animation loop, and D3 to help with collision
      detection. Because this example is declarative, we can split it into two
      parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Part 1: Rendering the marbles</li>
      <li>Part 2: Building the physics</li>
    </ul>

      and play around with a
      <a href="https://swizec.github.io/declarative-canvas-react-konva/"
        >hosted version</a
      >
      of the code you’re about to build.

      I know this example comes late in the book, and you’re feeling like you
      know all there is to React and visualizations. You can think of this
      example as practice. Plus it’s a good way to learn the basics of MobX.
