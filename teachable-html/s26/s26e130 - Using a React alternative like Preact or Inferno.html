    <h1 id="fractal-tree">Using a React alternative like Preact or Inferno</h1>
    <p>
      We’ve been using React so far, and that’s worked great. React is fast,
      easy to use, and not too hard to understand. However, two alternative
      frameworks promise the ease of React, but faster with a smaller
      footprint.

      <a href="https://github.com/developit/preact"><strong>Preact</strong></a>
      looks just like React when you’re using it, but the smaller code
      footprint means your apps open faster. Performing fewer sanity checks at
      runtime makes it faster to run too. Async rendering can make your apps
      feel even faster.

      also promises to look just like React when you’re using it, but its sole
      purpose in life is to be faster. According to its maintainers, converting
      to Inferno can improve performance of your real-world app by up to 110%.

    <p>
      Both Preact and Inferno have a
      <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">-compat</code> project that lets you
      convert existing React projects without any code modifications. While
      React has gotten much faster in recent years, so have Preact and Inferno.
      You should give them a try.
