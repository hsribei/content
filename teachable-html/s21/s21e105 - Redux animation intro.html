    <p>
      And now for some pure nerdy fun: A particle generator… or, well, as close
      as you can get with React and D3. You’d need WebGL for a
      <em>real</em> particle generator.

    <p>
      We’re making tiny circles fly out of your mouse cursor. Works on mobile
      with your finger, too.

    <p>
      To see the particle generator in action,
      <a href="https://swizec.github.io/react-particles-experiment/">go here</a
      >. Github won’t let me host different branches, so you’ll see the
      advanced 20,000 particle version from next chapter.

      We’re using the
      <a

      approach to animation and Redux to store the state tree and drive changes
      for each frame.

      You can see the full code
      <a href="https://github.com/Swizec/react-particles-experiment"
        >on GitHub</a
      >. I’ve merged the SVG and Canvas branches. Redux part is the same, some
      parameters differ. We’re focusing on the Redux part because that’s what’s
      new.

    <p>It’s going to be great.</p>

      {aside} Code in this example uses the
      <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">.jsx</code> file extension. I
      originally wrote it back when that was still a thing, and while I did
      update everything to React 16+, I felt that changing filenames was
      unnecessary. {/aside}
