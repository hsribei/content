<p>Weâ€™re about to throw around some terms. Youâ€™ll understand what they mean in detail after this chapter.</p>
<p>Until then, hereâ€™s a quick glossary so you donâ€™t feel lost:</p>
<p><strong>The store, or the state</strong>, is Redux state. Held globally and shared by all components. Itâ€™s like the App local state from earlier chapters.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong> are packets of information that tell us what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Reducers</strong> are functions that take the current state and an action, and use that information to generate a new state.</p>
<p>Got it? No worries. You will soon <span class="emoji" data-emoji="smiley">ðŸ˜ƒ</span></p>
