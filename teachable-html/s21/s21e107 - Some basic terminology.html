<h2 id="some-basic-terminology">Some basic terminology</h2>
<p>We’re about to throw around some terms. You’ll understand what they mean in detail after this chapter.</p>
<p>Until then, here’s a quick glossary so you don’t feel lost:</p>
<p><strong>The store, or the state</strong>, is Redux state. Held globally and shared by all components. It’s like the App local state from earlier chapters.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong> are packets of information that tell us what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Reducers</strong> are functions that take the current state and an action, and use that information to generate a new state.</p>
<p>Got it? No worries. You will soon :)</p>
