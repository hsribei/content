<h4 id="transitiongroup">TransitionGroup</h4>
<p>React TransitionGroup gives us coordinated control over a set of transitionable components. Each Letter is going to be a <code>&lt;Transition&gt;</code>, you’ll see.</p>
<p>We need TransitionGroup to gain declarative control over the enter/exit cycle. Transition components can handle transitions themselves, but they need an <code>in</code> prop to say whether they’re in or out of the visualization.</p>
<p>Flip from <code>false</code> to <code>true</code>, run an enter transition.</p>
<p><code>true</code> to <code>false</code>, run an exit transition.</p>
<p>We can make this change from within our component, of course. When responding to user events for example. In our case we need that control to come from outside based on which letters exist in the <code>alphabet</code> array.</p>
<p><code>TransitionGroup</code> handles that for us. It automatically passes the correct <code>in</code> prop to its children based on who is and isn’t being rendered.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, we can use TransitionGroup to set a bunch of default parameters for child Transitions. Whether to use <code>enter</code> animations, <code>exit</code> animations, stuff like that. You can read <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group">a full list in the docs</a>.</p>
