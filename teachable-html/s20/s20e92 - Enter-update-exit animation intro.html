<h1 id="enter-exit-animation">Enter/update/exit animation</h1>
<p>Now that you know how to use transitions, it’s time to take it up a notch. Enter/exit animations.</p>
<p>Enter/exit animations are the most common use of transitions. They’re what happens when a new element enters or exits the picture. For example: in visualizations like this famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLCF7vPanrY">Nuclear Detonation Timeline</a> by Isao Hashimoto. Each new Boom! flashes to look like an explosion.</p>
<p>I don’t know how Hashimoto did it, but with React &amp; D3, you’d do it with enter/exit transitions.</p>
<p>Another favorite of mine is this <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808234">animated alphabet</a> example by Mike Bostock, the creator of D3, that showcases enter/update/exit transitions.</p>
<p>That’s what we’re going to build: An animated alphabet. New letters fall down and are green, updated letters move right or left, deleted letters are red and fall down.</p>
<p>You can play with a more advanced version <a href="http://swizec.github.io/react-d3-enter-exit-transitions/">here</a>. Same principle as the alphabet, but it animates what you type.</p>

<p>We’re building the alphabet version because the <a href="https://swizec.com/blog/animated-string-diffing-with-react-and-d3/swizec/6952">string diffing algorithm</a> is a pain to explain. I learned that the hard way when giving workshops on React and D3…</p>

<p>See?</p>
<p>Easy on paper, but the code is long and weird. That, or I’m bad at implementing it. Either way, it’s too tangential to explain here. You can <a href="https://swizec.com/blog/animated-string-diffing-with-react-and-d3/swizec/6952">read the article about it</a>.</p>
