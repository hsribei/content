      You can play with a more complex version of this example here:
      <a href="http://swizec.github.io/react-d3-enter-exit-transitions/"
        >http://swizec.github.io/react-d3-enter-exit-transitions/</a
      >. Try typing different strings and see how the visualization reacts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The typing example uses the same Letter components to declaratively
      render its string, but it drives the input through your typing instead of
      an automatic shuffler.
