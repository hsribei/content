<h1 id="choropleth-map">Render a choropleth map of the US</h1>
<p>With our data in hand, it’s time to draw some pictures. A choropleth map will show us the best places to be in tech.</p>
<p>We’re showing the delta between median household salary in a statistical county and the average salary of an individual tech worker on a visa. The darker the blue, the higher the difference.</p>
<p>The more a single salary can out-earn an entire household, the better off you are.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of gray on this map because the shortened dataset doesn’t have that many counties. Full dataset is going to look better, I promise.</p>
<p>Turns out immigration visa opportunities for techies aren’t evenly distributed throughout the country. Who knew?</p>
<p>Just like before, we’re going to start with changes in our <code>App</code> component, then build the new bit. This time, a <code>CountyMap</code> component spread over three files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CountyMap/index.js</code>, to make imports easier</li>
<li><code>CountyMap/CountyMap.js</code>, for overall map logic</li>
<li><code>CountyMap/County.js</code>, for individual county polygons</li>
</ul>
