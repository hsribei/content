<h1 id="youre-awesome">You’re awesome</h1>
<p>You know the basics!</p>
<p>You can take any D3 example from the internets and wrap it in a React component, <em>and</em> you know how to build React+D3 components from scratch. You’re amazing. High five! :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:</p>
<p>The rest of this book is about using these concepts and pushing them to the limits of practicality. We’re going to build an interactive visualization of tech salaries compared to median household income.</p>
<p>Why? Because it piqued my interest, and because it shows why you should call yourself an engineer, not a programmer or a developer. <strong>You’re an engineer</strong>. Remember that.</p>
<p>Throughout the example, you’ll learn more details of D3, tidbits from React, and the animation chapter is going to blow your mind.</p>
<p>Super fun!</p>
