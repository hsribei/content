  Using transitions for simple animation
</h1>
<p>
  Game loops are great for fine-grained control. And when all you need is a
  little flourish on user action, that’s where transitions shine.
</p>
<p>No details, just keyframes.</p>
<p>
  Transitions let you animate SVG elements by saying
  <em
    >“I want this property to change to this new value and take this long
    to do so”</em
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Start-end keyframes are the simplest. You define the starting position.
  Start a transition. Define the end position. D3 figures out the rest.
  Everything from calculating the perfect rate of change to match your
  start and end values and your duration, to <em>what</em> to change and
  handling dropped frames.
</p>
<p>Quite magical.</p>
<p>
  You can also sequence transitions to create complex keyframe-based
  animation. Each new transition definition is like a new keyframe. D3
  figures out the rest.
</p>
<p>
  Better yet, you can use easing functions to make your animation look more
  natural. Make rate of change follow a mathematical curve to create smooth
  natural movement.
</p>
<p>
  You can read more about the <em>why</em> of easing functions in Disney’s
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation"
    >12 Basic Principles of Animation</a
  >. Bottom line is that it makes your animation feel natural.
</p>
<p>
  <em>How</em> they work is hard to explain. You can grok part of it in my

  article.
</p>
<p>
  But don’t worry about it. All you have to know is that many easing
  functions exist. <a href="https://easings.net/">easings.net</a> lists the
  common ones. D3 implements everything on that list.
