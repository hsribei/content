<p>
  You now know how to build a game loop and use it to run custom
  animations. 👏
</p>
<ul>
  <li>render from state</li>
  <li>change state 60 times per second</li>
  <li>reason about movement in snapshots</li>
  <li>deal with dropped frames</li>
  <li>complete control</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Complete control is nice, but the mental acrobatics are not. Getting game
  loops just right is hard.
</p>
<p>
  And that’s why I recommend transitions in most cases. Transitions can
  handle all of that for you out of the box.
