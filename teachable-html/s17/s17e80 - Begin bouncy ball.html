<p>Let’s get our feet wet with my favorite childhood example: a bouncing ball.</p>
<p>I must have built dozens of them back in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">Turbo Pascal</a> days using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Graphics_Interface">BGI</a>. Endless afternoons playing with different parameters in my bouncy ball examples.</p>
<p>Yes, those Turbo Pascal and BGI are from the 80’s. No, I’m not that old. I started young and with old equipment. Coding for DOS is easier when you’re a kid than coding for Windows 95.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of our bouncing ball:</p>

<p>Exciting, isn’t it? Took me five tries to catch it. Future examples will look better as screenshots, I promise.</p>
<p>I suggest you follow along on CodeSandbox. Here’s one I prepared for you earlier: <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/rrwz67jl04">click me</a></p>
