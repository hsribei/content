<h1 id="histogram-of-salaries">Render a Histogram of salaries</h1>
<p>
  Knowing median salaries is great and all, but it doesn’t tell you much
  about what you can expect. You need to know the distribution to see if
  it’s more likely you’ll get 140k or 70k.
</p>
<p>
  That’s what histograms are for. Give them a bunch of data, and they show
  its distribution. We’re going to build one like this:

  In the shortened dataset, 35% of tech salaries fall between $60k and
  $80k, 26% between $80k and $100k etc. Throwing a weighed dice with this
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"
    >random distribution</a
  >, you’re far more likely to get 60k-80k than 120k-140k. It’s a great way
  to gauge situations.

  It’s where statistics like “More people die from vending machines than
  shark attacks” come from. Which are you afraid of, vending machines or
  sharks? Stats say your answer should be

  We’ll start our histogram with some changes in
  <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">App.js</code>, make a
  <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Histogram</code> component using the
