<h1 id="histogram-of-salaries">Render a Histogram of salaries</h1>
<p>Knowing median salaries is great and all, but it doesn’t tell you much about what you can expect. You need to know the distribution to see if it’s more likely you’ll get 140k or 70k.</p>
<p>That’s what histograms are for. Give them a bunch of data, and they show its distribution. We’re going to build one like this:</p>

</figure>
<p>In the shortened dataset, 35% of tech salaries fall between $60k and $80k, 26% between $80k and $100k etc. Throwing a weighed dice with this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution">random distribution</a>, you’re far more likely to get 60k-80k than 120k-140k. It’s a great way to gauge situations.</p>
<p>It’s where statistics like “More people die from vending machines than shark attacks” come from. Which are you afraid of, vending machines or sharks? Stats say your answer should be <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm">heart disease</a>. ;)</p>
<p>We’ll start our histogram with some changes in <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">App.js</code>, make a <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Histogram</code> component using the <a href="#full-feature-integration">full-feature approach</a>, add an <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Axis</code> using the <a href="#blackbox-hoc">blackbox HOC approach</a>, and finally add some styling.</p>
