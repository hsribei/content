<h1 id="existing-libraries">When should you use an existing library? Which one?</h1>
<p>The quickest way to achieve the benefits of integrating React with D3 is to use a library. A collection of components with pre-built charting visualizations. Plug it into your app, move on with life.</p>
<p>Great option for basic charts. I recommend it dearly to anyone who comes to me and asks about building stuff. Try a library first. If it fits your needs, perfect! You just saved yourselves plenty of time.</p>
<p>Where libraries become a problem is when you want to move beyond the library authorâ€™s idea of How Things Are Done. Custom features, visualizations that arenâ€™t just charts, disabling this or that default behavior â€¦ it gets messy.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s why I rarely use libraries myself. Often find it quicker to build something specific from scratch than figuring out how to hold a generalized API just right.</p>
<p>But theyâ€™re a great first step. Hereâ€™s a few of the most popular React &amp; D3 libraries <span class="emoji" data-emoji="point_down">ðŸ‘‡</span></p>
