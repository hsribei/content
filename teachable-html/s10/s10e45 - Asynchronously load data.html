<p>Great! We have a preloader. Time to load some data.</p>
<p>
  We’ll use D3’s built-in data loading methods and tie their promises into
  React’s component lifecycle. You could talk to a REST API in the same
  way. Neither D3 nor React care what the datasource is.

<p>First, you need some data.</p>
<p>
  Our dataset comes from a few sources. Tech salaries are from
  <a href="https://h1bdata.info">h1bdata.info</a>, median household incomes
  come from the US census data, and I got US geo map info from Mike
  Bostock’s github repositories. Some elbow grease and python scripts tied
  them all together.
