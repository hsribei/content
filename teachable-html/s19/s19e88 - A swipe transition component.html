<h2 id="swipe-transition">Swipe transition</h2>
<p>Our goal is to build a declarative component fully controlled by props. We pass in the <code>x</code> coordinate and the coordinate figures out the rest.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t care about the transition or how long it takes. That’s up to the component. We just change <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>You can see it in action <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/618mr9r6nr">on CodeSandbox, here</a>. Tweak params, see what happens. Follow along as I explain how it works.</p>
