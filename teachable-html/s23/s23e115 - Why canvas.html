<h2 id="why-canvas">Why Canvas</h2>
<p>Unlike SVG, HTML5 Canvas lets you draw rasterized images. This means you’re no longer operating at the level of shapes because you’re working with pixels on the screen.</p>
<p>With SVG and other vector formats, you tell the browser <em>what</em> you want to render. With Canvas and other raster formats, you tell the browser <em>how</em> you want to render. The browser doesn’t know what you’re doing; it gets a field of pixel colors and renders them as an image.</p>
<p>That’s much faster for computers to handle. In some cases browsers can even use hardware acceleration – the GPU – to render HTML5 Canvas elements. With a bit of care, you can do almost anything you want, even on a mobile phone.</p>
<p>Phones these days have amazing GPUs and kind of terrible CPUs in comparison. The CPU burns more battery, works slower, warms up your phone more, etc.</p>
<p>If SVG wasn’t so easy to use, I’d almost suggest going straight to Canvas for any sort of complex animation. Mobile traffic is, what, 60% to 70% of web traffic these days?</p>
