<h1 id="state-handling-architecture">Handling state in your React app</h1>
<p>Before I can set you loose on the world, we should talk about managing state. It’s where most engineers shoot themselves in the foot.</p>
<p>You’ll notice you shot yourself in the foot six months ago when all of a sudden it becomes near impossible to build new features, add functionality, and know what’s going on with your app. If you find yourself spending a lot of time confused about why your UI does something, you’ve shot yourself in the foot.</p>
<p>Don’t worry tho, happens to everyone!</p>
<p>I shoot myself in the foot all the time. You can’t predict how your app is going to evolve. You can’t know how technology is going to improve. Can’t know how your team will grow.</p>
<p>Best approach is to optimize for change.</p>
<p>Otherwise you might have to do a rewrite. Rewrites are bad. One of the most infamous rewrite story is about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">The Rewrite that Killed Netscape</a>. You might not even have heard of Netscape ;)</p>
<p>Let’s save you from that.</p>
