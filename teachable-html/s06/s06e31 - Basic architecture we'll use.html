<p>We‚Äôre using a unidirectional data flow architecture with a single source of truth. That means you always know what to expect. Think of your app as a giant circle.</p>
<p>Data goes from your source of truth into your components. Events go from your components into your source of truth. All in one direction</p>

<p>Our main App component holds state for your entire application. Anything that multiple components should be aware of lives here. This state flows down the hierarchy via props. Changes happen via callbacks, also passed down through props.</p>
<p>Like this <span class="emoji" data-emoji="point_down">üëá</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The Main Component ‚Äì <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">App</code> ‚Äì holds the truth</li>
<li>Truth flows down through props</li>
<li>Child components react to user events</li>
<li>They announce changes using callbacks</li>
<li>The Main Component updates its truth</li>
<li>Updates flow back down the chain</li>
<li>UI updates through re-renders</li>
</ul>
<p>This looks roundabout, but it‚Äôs amazing. Far better than worrying about parts of the UI growing out of sync with the rest of your app. I could talk your ear off with debugging horror stories, but I‚Äôm nice, so I won‚Äôt.</p>
<p>When a user clicks one of our controls, a <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Toggle</code>, it invokes a callback. This in turn invokes a callback on <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">ControlRow</code>, which invokes a callback on <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Controls</code>, which invokes a callback on <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">App</code>.</p>

</figure>
<p>With each hop, the nature of our callback changes. <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Toggle</code> tells <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">ControlRow</code> which entry was toggled, <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">ControlRow</code> tells <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Controls</code> how to update the data filter function, and <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Controls</code> gives <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">App</code> a composite filter built from all the controls. You‚Äôll see how that works in the next chapter.</p>
<p>All you have to remember right now is that callbacks evolve from passing low-level information to high-level business logic. Starts with <em>‚ÄúI was clicked‚Äù</em> ends with <em>‚ÄúUpdate visualization filter‚Äù</em></p>
<p>When the final callback is invoked, <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">App</code> updates its repository of truth ‚Äì <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">this.state</code> ‚Äì and communicates the change back down the chain via props. No additional wiring needed on your part. React‚Äôs got you covered.</p>

<p>You can think of it like calling functions with new arguments. Because the functions ‚Äì components ‚Äì render the UI, your interface updates.</p>
<p>Because your components are well-made and rely on their props to render, React‚Äôs engine can optimize these changes. It compares the new and old component trees and decides which components to re-render and which to leave alone.</p>
<p>Functional programming for HTML! <span class="emoji" data-emoji="sunglasses">üòé</span></p>
<p>The functional programming concepts we‚Äôre relying on are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency">referential transparency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">idempotent functions</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">functional purity</a>. I suggest Googling them if you want to learn the theory behind it all.</p>
