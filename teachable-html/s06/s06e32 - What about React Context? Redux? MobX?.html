<h2 id="what-about-react-context-redux-mobx">What about React Context? Redux? MobX?</h2>
<p>You may have heard of React Context, Redux, MobX and other state handling libraries. They’re all great in different ways and the internet can’t decide which one is best. Everyone has their own little twist on the story.</p>
<p>And yet the basic principles are all the same:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Single source of truth</li>
<li>State flows down</li>
<li>Updates flow up</li>
</ol>
<p>Where React Context, Redux, MobX and other libraries help, is how much work it is to build this machinery and keep it running. How much flexibility you get when moving components. Basically how easy it is to change your app later.</p>
<p>Remember the rewrite conundrum?</p>
<p>Our basic approach binds business structure to UI structure. Your state, your props, your callbacks, they all follow the same hierarchy as your UI does.</p>
<p>Want to move the buy button? Great! You have to update the entire chain of components leading from your state to that button.</p>
<p>Everything needs new callbacks and new props.</p>
<p>This is known as prop drilling and fast becomes super tedious. Rewiring your whole app just to move a single button is no fun.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, React Context, Redux, MobX, etc. decouple your business logic from your UI architecture. Take state out of the main component and move it into its own object. Connect everything to that instead.</p>
<p>[picture]</p>
<p>Now it doesn’t matter where you move that button. It still triggers the same function on the same state. Every other component that cares about that state updates too.</p>
<p>Different libraries have different details for how that works, but they all follow the same idea and solve the same problem.</p>
<hr>
<p>We’re sticking with the basic approach because it’s easier to explain, works without additional libraries, and is Good Enough™.</p>
