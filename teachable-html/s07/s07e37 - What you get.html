  Running
  <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">create-react-app</code> installs
  tools and libraries. There’s around 80MB of them as of October 2016. This
  is why using a generator is easier than slogging through on your own.
</p>
<p>
  Crucially, there is a single dependency in your project –
  <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">react-scripts</code>. But it gives
  you everything you need to build modern React apps.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Webpack</strong> - a module bundler and file loader. It turns
    your app into a single JavaScript file, and it even lets you import
    images and styles like they were code.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Babel</strong> - a JavaScript transpiler. It turns your modern
    JS code (ES6, ECMAScript2015, 2016, ES7, whatever you call it) into
    code that can run on real world browsers. It’s the ecosystem’s answer
    to slow browser adoption.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>ESLint</strong> - linting! It annoys you when you write code
    that is bad. This is a good thing. 😄
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Jest</strong> - a test runner. Having tests set up from the
    beginning of a project is a good idea. We won’t really write tests in
    this book, but I will show you how it’s done.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All tools come preconfigured with sane defaults and ready to use. You
  have no idea how revolutionary this is. Check the appendixes to see how
  hard setting up an environment used to be. I’m so happy that
  <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">create-react-app</code> exists.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Besides the toolchain,
  <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">create-react-app</code> also gives
  you a default directory structure and a ton of helpful docs.
</p>
<p>
  You should read the
  <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">README.md</code> file. It’s full of
  great advice, and it goes into more detail about the app generator than
  we can get into here. The team also makes sure it’s kept up-to-date.
</p>
<p>
  All of the code samples in this book are going to follow the default
  directory structure. Public assets like HTML files, datasets, and some
  images go into <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">public/</code>. Code
  goes into <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">src/</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Code is anything that we
  <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">import</code> or
  <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">require()</code>. That includes
  JavaScript files themselves, as well as stylesheets and images.
</p>
<p>
  You can poke around
  <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">src/App.js</code> to see how it’s
  structured and what happens when you change something. You’re going to
  change bits and pieces of this file as you go through the book.
</p>
<p>
  I suggest you keep
  <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">npm start</code> running at all
  times while coding. The browser will refresh on every code change, so
  you’ll be able to see instant results.
