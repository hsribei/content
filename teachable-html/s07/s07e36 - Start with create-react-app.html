<p>Modern JavaScript development runs on node.js. Your code still ends up in a browser, but there are a few steps it has to go through before it gets there. Those toolchains run on node.js.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">nodejs.org</a>, download one of the latest versions, and run the installer. You can pick the more stable LTS (long-term-support) version, or the more gimme-all-the-features version. JavaScript toolchains run fine in both.</p>
<p>Server-side rendering might be easier with the fancy-pants version. More on that later.</p>
<h2 id="install-create-react-app">Install create-react-app</h2>
<p>Great, you have node and you’re ready to go.</p>
<p>Run this command in a terminal:</p>
<pre data-caption="Install create-react-app"><code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">$ npm install -g create-react-app</code></pre>
<p>This installs a global npm package called <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">create-react-app</code>. Its job is to create a directory and install <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">react-scripts</code>.</p>
<p>Confusing, I know.</p>
<p>You can think of <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">create-react-app</code> and <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">react-scripts</code> as two parts of the same construction. The first is a lightweight script that you can install globally and never update; the second is where the work happens. You want this one to be fresh every time you start a new app.</p>
<p>Keeping a global dependency up to date would suck, especially considering there have been six major updates since Facebook first launched <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">create-react-app</code> in July 2016.</p>
<h2 id="run-create-react-app">Run create-react-app</h2>
<p>Superb! You have <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">create-react-app</code>. Time to create an app and get started with some coding.</p>
<p>Run this in a terminal:</p>
<pre data-caption="Create your project"><code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">$ create-react-app react-d3js-example</code></pre>
<p>Congratulations! You just created a React app. <em>With</em> all the setup and the fuss that goes into using a modern JavaScript toolchain.</p>
<p>Your next step is to run your app:</p>
<pre data-caption="Start your dev server"><code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">$ cd react-d3js-example
$ npm start</code></pre>
<p>A browser tab should open with a page that looks like this:</p>

<p>If that didn’t work, then something must have gone terribly wrong. You should consult <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">the official docs</a>. Maybe that will help.</p>
