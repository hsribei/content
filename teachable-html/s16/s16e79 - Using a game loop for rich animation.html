    <h1 id="game-loop">Using a game loop for rich animation</h1>
    <p>
      Game loops are fun! They’re my favorite. They even sound fun: “game
      loop”. Doesn’t it sound fun to go build a game loop? Maybe it’s because
      I’ve always used game loops when building something fun to play with.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its core, a game loop is an infinite loop where each iteration renders
      the next frame of your animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept comes from the video game industry. At some point they
      realized that building game engines is much easier when you think about
      each frame as its own static representation of your game state.
    </p>
    <p>
      You take every object in the game and render it. Then you throw it all
      away, make small adjustments, and render again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This turns out to be both faster to run and easier to implement than
      diffing scenes and figuring out what moves and what doesn’t. Of course as
      you get more objects on the screen it becomes silly to re-render the
      immovable background every time.
    </p>
    <p>But you don’t have to worry about that. That’s React’s job.</p>
    <p>
      React can figure out a diff between hierarchical representations of your
      scene and re-render the appropriate objects.
    </p>
    <p>That’s a hard engineering problem, but you can think of it this way:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Render a DOM from state</li>
      <li>Change some values in state</li>
      <li>Trigger a re-render</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Make those state changes fast enough and you get 60 frames per second.
      The hard part then becomes thinking about your movement as snapshots in
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When something speeds up, what does that mean for changes in its
      position?
