To show your dataviz to the world, make sure you’ve committed all
changes. Using `git status` shows you anything you missed.

Then run:

    $ npm run deploy

You’ll see a bunch of output:

And you’re ready to go. Your visualization is online. My URL is
`https://swizec.github.io/react-d3js-step-by-step/`, yours is different.
Visit it and you’ll see what you’ve built. Share it and others will see
it too.

Thanks for following along with the meaty part of my book. You’re now
well equipped to build cool things.

In the next section, we’re going to look at building animations.
