## Props might update

The story is a little different when our props might update. Since weâ€™re
using D3 objects to calculate SVG properties, we have to make sure those
objects are updated *before* we render.

No problem in React 15: Update in `componentWillUpdate`. But since React
16.3 weâ€™ve been told never to use that again. Causes problems for modern
async rendering.

The official recommended solution is that anything that used to go in
`componentWillUpdate`, can go in `componentDidUpdate`. But not so fast\!

Updating D3 objects in `componentDidUpdate` would mean our visualization
always renders one update behind. Stale renders\! ðŸ˜±

The new `getDerivedStateFromProps` to the rescue. Our integration
follows a 3-step pattern:

  - set up D3 objects in component state
  - update D3 objects in `getDerivedStateFromProps`
  - output SVG in `render()`

`getDerivedStateFromProps` is officially discouraged, and yet the best
tool we have to make sure D3 state is updated *before* we render.

Because React calls `getDerivedStateFromProps` on every component
render, not just when our props actually change, you should avoid
recalculating complex things too often. Use memoization helpers, check
for changes before updating, stuff like that.

### An updateable scatterplot

Letâ€™s update our scatterplot so it can deal with resizing and updating
data.

3 steps ðŸ‘‡

  - add an interaction that resizes the scatterplot
  - move scales to state
  - update scales in `getDerivedStateFromProps`

You can see [my final solution on
CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/ll9kp8or0l). I recommend you
follow along updating your existing
code.

#### Resize scatterplot on click

To test our scatterplotâ€™s adaptability, we have to add an interaction:
Resize the scatterplot on click.

That change happens in `App.js`. Click on the `<svg>`, reduce width and
height by 30%.

Move sizing into App state and add an `onClick` handler.

``` javascript
// App.js
class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    width: 300,
    height: 300
  };

  onClick = () => {
    const { width, height } = this.state;
    this.setState({
      width: width * 0.7,
      height: height * 0.7
    });
  };

  render() {
    const { width, height } = this.state;
```

We changed our App component from a function to a class, added `state`
with default `width` and `height`, and an `onClick` method that reduces
size by 30%. The `render` method reads `width` and `height` from state.

Now gotta change rendering to listen to these values and fire the
`onClick` handler.

``` javascript
// App.js

<svg width="800" height="800" onClick={this.onClick}>
  <Scatterplot
    x={50}
    y={50}
    width={width}
    height={height}
    data={data}
  />
</svg>
```

Similar rendering as before. We have an `<svg>` that contains a
`<Scatterplot>`. The svg fires `this.onClick` on click events and the
scatterplot uses our `width` and `height` values for its props.

If you try this code now, you should see a funny effect where axes move,
but the scatterplot doesnâ€™t resize.

![Axes move, scatterplot doesnâ€™t
resize](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/not-resizing-scatterplot.png)

Peculiar isnâ€™t it? Try to guess why.

#### Move scales to state

The horizontal axis moves because itâ€™s render at `height` vertical
coordinate. Datapoints donâ€™t move because the scales that position them
are calculated once â€“Â on component mount.

First step to keeping scales up to date is to move them from component
values into state.

``` javascript
// Scatterplot.js
class Scatterplot extends React.Component {
  state = {
    xScale: d3
      .scaleLinear()
      .domain([0, 1])
      .range([0, this.props.width]),
    yScale: d3
      .scaleLinear()
      .domain([0, 1])
      .range([this.props.height, 0])
  };
```

Same scale definition code we had before. Linear scales, domain from 0
to 1, using props for ranges. But now theyâ€™re wrapped in a `state = {}`
object and itâ€™s `xScale: d3 ...` instead of `xScale = d3 ...`.

Our render function should use these as well. Small change:

``` javascript
// Scatterplot.js
    render() {
    const { x, y, data, height } = this.props,
      { yScale, xScale } = this.state;

    return (
      <g transform={`translate(${x}, ${y})`}>
        {data.map(([x, y]) => <circle cx={xScale(x)} cy={yScale(y)} r="5" />)}
```

We use destructuring to take our scales from state, then use them when
mapping over our data.

Clicking on the SVG produces the same result as before, but weâ€™re almost
there. Just one more step.

#### Update scales in `getDerivedStateFromProps`

Last step is to update our scalesâ€™ ranges in `getDerivedStateFromProps`.
This method runs every time React touches our component for any reason.

``` javascript
// Scatterplot.js
class Scatterplot extends React.PureComponent {
    // ..
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    const { yScale, xScale } = state;

    yScale.range([props.height, 0]);
    xScale.range([0, props.width]);

    return {
      ...state,
      yScale,
      xScale
    };
  }
```

Take scales from state, update ranges with new values, return new state.
Nice and easy.

Notice that `getDerivedStateFromProps` is a static method shared by all
instances of our Scatterplot component. You have no reference to a
`this` and have to calculate new state purely from the `props` and
`state` passed into your method.

Itâ€™s a lot like a Redux reducer, if that helps you think about it. If
you donâ€™t know what Redux reducers are, donâ€™t worry. Just remember to
return a new version of component state.

Your Scatterplot should now update its size on every click.
