I’m going to assume you already know how to code and that you’re great
with JavaScript. Many books have been written to teach the basics of
JavaScript; this is not one of them.

If you’re struggling with modern JavaScript syntax, I suggest visiting
my [Interactive ES6 Cheatsheet](https://es6cheatsheet.com)

I’m assuming you’ve tried D3 before, or at least heard of it. You don’t
have to know how D3 works, or understand what the code you copy pasted
to meet a deadline does. I’ll show you all you need to know.

If you want to learn D3 in depth, there’s plenty of great resources out
there. For example, the third edition of my first ever book, [D3.js 4.x
Data Visualization - Third
Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/d3js-4x-data-visualization-third-edition).
Written by Ændrew Rininsland with some chapters left from yours truly.

As for React, same deal: I expect you have some idea how to use it, but
you’ll be fine even if this is your first time looking at React. We’ll
go through everything you need to know as it’s happening.

All examples in React + D3 use modern JavaScript. That is JavaScript
from ES6 – ES2015 – and beyond. No special mods, just stuff you get by
default in all React projects in recent years. Even if some syntax isn’t
in the standard yet.
