Hello new friend\! 👋

![This is me, Swizec](images/es6v2/6300d21408f5e9f0c8f5698d266fb258.jpg)

Welcome to what I hope is the best and most fun React and D3 learning
resource on the internet. No TODO apps here, just fun interactive stuff
that makes you look great at a dinner party.

After an hour with *React + D3*, you’ll know how to make React and D3.js
play together. You’ll know how to create composable data visualizations.
Understand *why* that’s a good idea, and you will have the tools to
build your own library of interactive visualization components. Or use
*and understand* somebody else’s.

It’s going to be fun\!

I believe learning new tech should be exciting, so I did my best to
inject joy whenever I could.

250+ pages as a book, 8 example apps, near 8 hours of video, a bunch of
skill building blocks. 👌

Going through this course you will:

  - build a bunch of reusable visualization components
  - build an interactive data dashboard
  - learn about reusable animation components
  - learn the basics of D3.js
  - master React
  - learn the basics of Redux and MobX
  - look into rendering rich animations on canvas
  - explore React alternatives like Preact and Inferno
  - learn about server-side rendering
  - learn a few basics of data science
  - learn some WebGL and 3D rendering

You might be thinking *“How the hell does this all fit together to help
me build interactive graphs and charts?”*. They’re building blocks\!

First I will show you the basics. Stuff like how to make React and D3
like each other, how to approach rendering, what to do with state.

Then you’ll build a big project to see how it all fits together.

When you’re comfortable with React and D3 working together, I will show
you animation. Cool things like how to approach updating components with
fine grained control and how to do transitions. I’ll show you how tricks
from the gaming industry work on the web.

Short on time? Don’t worry.

The initial examples work in CodeSandbox, a web-based IDE. Read the
explanation, run the code, master enough React to be dangerous. You
won’t even have to leave the browser.

In about an hour, you’ll know React and D3 well enough to explore on
your own, to sell the tech to your boss and your team, and to assess if
the React+D3 combination fits your needs.

I believe learning new tech should be exciting.

# Foreword

I wrote the first version of React+D3 in Spring 2015 as a dare. Can I
learn a thing and write a book in a month? Yes.

That first version was 91 pages long and sold a few hundred copies.
Great success\!

You are reading, and watching, the pinnacle of how this material has
evolved over almost 4 years. 4 years I’ve been working on this. Not
every day, not all the time.

Little experiments here and there, launches and relaunches about once a
year. Learning how to do video, exploring new approaches, hosting
in-person workshops.

A lot has changed.

React isn’t what it used to be. The internals are different, the API is
easier to use. Hooks just flipped everything on its head all over again.
Suspense and async rendering are here and getting even better.

D3 has seen less change, but still went through major improvements. It’s
easier to use now. Easier to understand. More modern.

It feels like the web development world is a different place in late
2018 than it was in early 2015. It really does. Look at my code from 3
years ago and I think *“What\!? We used to live like this? This is
horrible”*

Almost 200 people bought this version of React+D3 in preorders alone. It
started as a book update and grew into a proper online course.

If you’re one of those early supporters, thank you\! You are the best.
Without you this never would have happened. 🙏🏻

Because I think it’s interesting, here’s what I had to say about that
first version back in 2015:

> I wrote this book for you as an experiment. The theory we’re testing
> is that technical content works better as a short e-book than as a
> long article.

> You see, the issue with online articles is that they live and die by
> their length. As soon as you surpass 700 words, everything falls
> apart. Readers wander off to a different tab in search of memes and
> funny tweets, never to come back.

> This hurts my precious writer’s ego, but more importantly, it sucks
> for you. If you’re not reading, you’re not learning.

> So here we both are.

> I’m counting on you to take some time away from the internet, to sit
> down and read. I’m counting on you to follow the examples. I’m
> counting on you to *learn*.

> You’re counting on me to have invested more time, effort, and care in
> crafting this than I would have invested in an article. I have.

> I’ve tried to keep this book as concise as possible. iA Writer
> estimates it will take you about an hour to read *React+d3.js*, but
> playing with the examples might take some time, too.

A lot of that still rings true. People are distracted, busy, the
internet is shiny. It’s hard to sit down and learn stuff.

The most common feedback I get from students goes something like this 👇

> Loving your book\! It’s amazing. So clear and concise and relatable.
> But I read 20 pages, then my wife had a kid, my boss pulled the
> project, and I’m doing backend now. But truly amazing. I’m gonna get
> back to it as soon as I can\!

Sometimes they do.

That’s okay. Life happens. I understand. Hell, I procrastinated for
months before sitting down to update this stuff :)

I recommend you go through the basic chapters at least. The little
building blocks. You can do that in an afternoon or two. It’s worth it,
