How to approach React for Data Visualization

I recommend starting with an idea, a problem. Something you want to
build. A dataset you want to play with. A feature you want to add to
your app.

That makes it easier. Helps focus your brain. Notice things in this
course that help *you* specifically.

From there, I think you should see how much time you’ve got. The course
is designed so you can go over the important stuff in a couple hours.
Watch a video, read some text, try some code. See how it feels.

If the best way is a daily practice, 20 minutes after work, 5 minutes on
the pooper, do that. If you’re more of a sit down and cram it out kind
of person, a nice Sunday afternoon with some coffee will do just fine.

But don’t make it a chore. We’re here to have fun :)

Two suggestions ✌️:

1.  *Try* the example code. Don’t just copy-paste; type it and execute
    it. Execute frequently. If something doesn’t fit together, look at
    the linked Github repositories or solved CodeSandboxes. Each project
    has one.
2.  If you know something, skip that section. You’re awesome. ❤️

React + D3 is based on code samples. They look like this:

``` javascript
let foo = 'bar';
foo += 'more stuff';
```

Each code sample starts with a commented out file path. That’s the file
you’re editing. Like this:

``` javascript
// ./src/App.js

class App ...
```

Commands that you should run in the terminal start with an `$` symbol,
like this:

    $ npm start
