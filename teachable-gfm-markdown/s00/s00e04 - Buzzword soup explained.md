# Buzzword soup explained

We’re going to use some buzzwords in this book. Hell, we’ve used some
already. Most will get a thorough explanation further on, but let me
give you a quick rundown.

  - **Babel**, a JavaScript transpiler that makes your code work on all
    browsers.
  - **ECMAScript2015,16,17,18**, official names for JavaScript as new
    features come out every summer
  - **ES5**, any JavaScript features that existed before June 2015
  - **ES6** or **ES6+**, a common name for JavaScript as it exists past
    June 2015
  - **fat arrows**, a new way to define functions in ES6 (`=>`)
  - **Git**, a version control system. It’s pretty popular, you probably
    know it :)
  - **H1B**, a popular type of work visa in the United States
  - **JSX**, a language/syntax that lets you use `<a href="/example">`
    as a native part of JavaScript
  - **Mustache**, a popular way to write HTML templates for JavaScript
    code. Uses `{{ ... }}` syntax.
  - **npm**, most popular package manager for JavaScript libraries
  - **props**, component properties set when rendering
  - **state**, a local dictionary of values available in most components
  - **functional components**, React components expressed as pure
    functions that take props and return markup
  - **Webpack**, a module packager for JavaScript. Makes it more
    convenient to organize code into multiple files. Provides cool
    plugins.
