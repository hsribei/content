It’s going to be great.

At this point, I assume you’ve used `create-react-app` to set up your
environment. Check the [getting started](#getting-started) section if
you haven’t. I’m also assuming you’ve read the [basics
chapter](#the-meat-start). I’m still going to explain what we’re doing,
but knowing the basics helps.

I suggest you follow along, keep `npm start` running, and watch your
visualization change in real time as you code. It’s rewarding as hell.
