# Declarative HTML5 Canvas with Konva and react-konva

Enter [Konva](https://konvajs.github.io) and react-konva. All the
benefits of declarative code, but rendered on the canvas.

I’m gonna let Anton Lavrenov, the author of Konva, explain:

> Konva is an HTML5 Canvas JavaScript framework that enables high
> performance animations, transitions, node nesting, layering,
> filtering, caching, event handling for desktop and mobile
> applications, and much more.

> You can draw things onto the stage, add event listeners to them, move
> them, scale them, and rotate them independently from other shapes to
> support high performance animations, even if your application uses
> thousands of shapes. Served hot with a side of awesomeness.

That.

It’s exactly what we need to push our animated React apps to thousands
of elements without spending too much time thinking about the *how* of
rendering. Best leave the hairy details to somebody else.

Let’s try out two examples:

1.  Pushing our particle generator to 20,000 elements
2.  An n-body collision simulator built with MobX
