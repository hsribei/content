## Game loop recap

You now know how to build a game loop and use it to run custom
animations. 👏

  - render from state
  - change state 60 times per second
  - reason about movement in snapshots
  - deal with dropped frames
  - complete control

Complete control is nice, but the mental acrobatics are not. Getting
game loops just right is hard.

And that’s why I recommend transitions in most cases. Transitions can
handle all of that for you out of the box.
