## A bouncing ball game loop example

Let’s get our feet wet with my favorite childhood example: a bouncing
ball.

I must have built dozens of them back in my [Turbo
Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) days using
[BGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Graphics_Interface). Endless
afternoons playing with different parameters in my bouncy ball examples.

Yes, those Turbo Pascal and BGI are from the 80’s. No, I’m not that old.
I started young and with old equipment. Coding for DOS is easier when
you’re a kid than coding for Windows 95.

Here is a screenshot of our bouncing ball:

Exciting, isn’t it? Took me five tries to catch it. Future examples will
look better as screenshots, I promise.

I suggest you follow along on CodeSandbox. Here’s one I prepared for you
