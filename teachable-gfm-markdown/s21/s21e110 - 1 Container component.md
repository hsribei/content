## 1 Container component

Containers are React components that talk to the Redux data store.

You can think of presentation components as templates that render stuff
and containers as smart-ish views that talk to controllers. Or maybe
theyâ€™re the controllers.

Sometimes itâ€™s hard to tell. In theory presentation components render
and donâ€™t think, containers communicate and donâ€™t render. Redux reducers
and actions do the thinking.

Iâ€™m not sure this separation is necessary in small projects.

Maintaining it can be awkward and sometimes cumbersome in mid-size
projects, but Iâ€™m sure it makes total sense at Facebook scale. Weâ€™re
using it in this project because the community has decided thatâ€™s the
way to go.

We use the idiomatic `connect()` approach. Like this:

``` javascript
// src/containers/AppContainer.jsx

import { connect } from "react-redux";
import React, { Component } from "react";
import * as d3 from "d3";

import App from "../components";
import {
    tickTime,
    tickerStarted,
    startParticles,
    stopParticles,
    updateMousePos
} from "../actions";

class AppContainer extends Component {
    startTicker = () => {
        const { isTickerStarted } = this.props;

        if (!isTickerStarted) {
            console.log("Starting ticker");
            this.props.tickerStarted();
            d3.timer(this.props.tickTime);
        }
    };

    render() {
        const { svgWidth, svgHeight, particles } = this.props;

        return (
            <App
                svgWidth={svgWidth}
                svgHeight={svgHeight}
                particles={particles}
                startTicker={this.startTicker}
                startParticles={this.props.startParticles}
                stopParticles={this.props.stopParticles}
                updateMousePos={this.props.updateMousePos}
            />
        );
    }
}

const mapStateToProps = ({
    generateParticles,
    mousePos,
    particlesPerTick,
    isTickerStarted,
    svgWidth,
    svgHeight,
    particles
}) => ({
    generateParticles,
    mousePos,
    particlesPerTick,
    isTickerStarted,
    svgWidth,
    svgHeight,
    particles
});

const mapDispatchToProps = {
    tickTime,
    tickerStarted,
    startParticles,
    stopParticles,
    updateMousePos
};

export default connect(
    mapStateToProps,
    mapDispatchToProps
)(AppContainer);
```

I love the smell of boilerplate in the morning. ðŸ‘ƒ

We import dependencies and define `AppContainer` as a class-based React
`Component` so we have somewhere to put the D3 interval. The render
method outputs our `<App>` component using a bunch of props to pass
relevant actions and values.

The `startTicker` method is a callback we pass into App. It runs on
first click and starts the D3 interval if necessary. Each interval
iteration triggers the `tickTime` action.

### AppContainer talks to the store

``` javascript
// src/containers/AppContainer.jsx

const mapStateToProps = ({
    generateParticles,
    mousePos,
    particlesPerTick,
    isTickerStarted,
    svgWidth,
    svgHeight,
    particles
}) => ({
    generateParticles,
    mousePos,
    particlesPerTick,
    isTickerStarted,
    svgWidth,
    svgHeight,
    particles
});

const mapDispatchToProps = {
    tickTime,
    tickerStarted,
    startParticles,
    stopParticles,
    updateMousePos
};

export default connect(
    mapStateToProps,
    mapDispatchToProps
)(AppContainer);
```

Weâ€™re using the `connect()` idiom to connect our AppContainer to the
Redux store. Itâ€™s a higher order component that handles all the details
of connection to the store and staying in sync.

We pass two arguments into connect. This returns a higher order
component function, which we wrap around AppContainer.

The first argument is **mapStateToProps**. It accepts current state as
an argument, which we immediately deconstruct into interesting parts,
and returns a key:value dictionary. Each key becomes a component prop
with the corresponding value.

Youâ€™d often use this opportunity to run ad-hoc calculations, or combine
parts of state into single props. No need for that in our case, just
pass it through.

#### Dispatching actions

**mapDispatchToProps** is a dictionary that maps props to actions. Each
prop turns into an action generator wrapped in a `store.dispatch()`
call. To fire an action inside a component we just call the function in
that prop.

But Swiz, weâ€™re not writing key:value dictionaries, weâ€™re just listing
stuff\!

Thatâ€™s a syntax supported in most modern JavaScript environments, called
object literal property value shorthand. Our build system expands that
`mapDispatchToProps` dictionary into something like this:

``` javascript
const mapDispatchToProps = {
    tickTime: tickTime,
    tickerStarted: tickerStarted,
    startParticles: startParticles,
    stopParticles: stopParticles,
    updateMousePos: updateMousePos
};
```

And you thought previous code had a lot of boilerplate â€¦ imagine if this
was how youâ€™d do it in real life ðŸ˜›

`connect` wraps each of these action generators in `store.dispatch()`
calls. You can pass the resulting function into any component and fire
actions by calling that method.

#### The Redux loop

To make a change therefore, a Redux loop unfolds:

1.  Call our action triggerer, passed in through props
2.  Calls the generator, gets a `{type: ...}` object
3.  Dispatches that object on the store
4.  Redux calls the reducer
5.  Reducer creates new state
6.  Store updates triggering Reactâ€™s engine to flow updates through the
    props

So thatâ€™s the container. 71 lines of boilerplate pretty code.

The remaining piece of the puzzle is our reducer. Two reducers in fact.
