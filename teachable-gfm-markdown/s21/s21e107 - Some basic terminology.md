## Some basic terminology

We’re about to throw around some terms. You’ll understand what they mean
in detail after this chapter.

Until then, here’s a quick glossary so you don’t feel lost:

**The store, or the state**, is Redux state. Held globally and shared by
all components. It’s like the App local state from earlier chapters.

**Actions** are packets of information that tell us what happened.

**Reducers** are functions that take the current state and an action,
and use that information to generate a new state.

Got it? No worries. You will soon :)
