## 3 key insights that help you learn D3.js from scratch

Somebody once asked me how to learn D3.js from scratch. I quipped that
it took me writing a book to really learn it. Itâ€™s one hell of a
library.

Most people donâ€™t go that far. They donâ€™t have to.

You start with a problem, find similar examples, do some copy pasta,
tweak until it works and end up with a working visualization you donâ€™t
understand. Youâ€™d be surprised how few engineers actually understand how
their D3 data visualization works.

Fear not\! There are just 3 key concepts you have to grok. Then you can
understand every D3 example out there. ðŸ˜±
