## Step 0: Get the data

Download the 6 data files from [my step-by-step repository on
Github](https://github.com/Swizec/react-d3js-step-by-step/commit/8819d9c38b4aef0a0c569e493f088ff9c3bfdf33).
Put them in your `public/data` directory.

The quickest way to download each file is to click `View`, then
right-click `Raw` and `Save Link As`.
