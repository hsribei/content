# Make it understandable - meta info

You’ve come so far\! There’s a US map and a histogram. They’re blue and
shiny and you look at them and you go *“Huh?”*.

The key to a good data visualization is telling users what it means. An
easy way to do that is a good title and description. Just tell them. The
picture supports the words, the words explain the picture.

Let’s add those words.

We’re adding a dynamic title and description, and a median line on the
histogram. The text is dynamic because we’re adding user controls later,
and we want the pictures and the words to stay in sync.

At the end of this section, you’ll have a full visualization of the
shortened dataset.
