## Step 1: Get the image

Download [my screenshot from
Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-step-by-step/798ec9eca54333da63b91c66b93339565d6d582a/src/assets/preloading.png)
and save it in `src/assets/preloading.png`. It goes in the `src/assets/`
directory because weâ€™re going to `import` it in JavaScript (which makes
it part of our source code), and I like to put non-JavaScript files in
`assets`. Keeps the project organized.
