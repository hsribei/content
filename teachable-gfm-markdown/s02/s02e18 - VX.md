[![VX](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/vx.png)](https://vx-demo.now.sh/)

VX is the closest to the approaches you’re learning in this book. React
for rendering, D3 for calculations. When you build a set of custom
components for your organization, a flavor of VX is what you often come
up with.

That’s why I recommend teams use VX when they need to get started
quickly.

Here’s what it takes to implement a Barchart using Nivo. [You can try it
on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/k5853pryrv)

``` javascript
const data = [
  { quarter: 1, earnings: 13000 },
  { quarter: 2, earnings: 16500 },
  { quarter: 3, earnings: 14250 },
  { quarter: 4, earnings: 19000 }
];

const App = ({ width = 400, height = 400 }) => {
  const xMax = width;
  const yMax = height - 120;

  const x = d => d.quarter;
  const y = d => d.earnings;

  // scales
  const xScale = scaleBand({
    rangeRound: [0, xMax],
    domain: data.map(x),
    padding: 0.4
  });
  const yScale = scaleLinear({
    rangeRound: [yMax, 0],
    domain: [0, max(data, y)]
  });

  return (
    <div style={styles}>
      <h1>VX basic demo</h1>
      <svg width={width} height={height}>
        {data.map((d, i) => {
          const barHeight = yMax - yScale(y(d));
          return (
            <Bar
              width={xScale.bandwidth()}
              height={barHeight}
              x={xScale(x(d))}
              y={yMax - barHeight}
              data={{ x: x(d), y: y(d) }}
            />
          );
        })}
      </svg>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Move involved than previous examples, but means you have more control
and fight the library less often. VX does the tedious stuff for you, so
you can focus on the stuff that matters.

This code creates value accessor methods, D3 scales, then iterates over
an array of `data` and renders a `<Bar` for each. The bar gets a bunch
of props.
