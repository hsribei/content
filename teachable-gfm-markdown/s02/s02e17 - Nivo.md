Nivo is another attempt to give you a set of basic charting components.
Comes with great interactive documentation, support for Canvas and API
rendering. Plenty of basic customization.

Hereâ€™s what it takes to implement a Barchart using Nivo. [You can try it
on
CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/n1wwkvq24)

``` javascript
const data = [
  { quarter: 1, earnings: 13000 },
  { quarter: 2, earnings: 16500 },
  { quarter: 3, earnings: 14250 },
  { quarter: 4, earnings: 19000 }
];

const App = () => (
  <div style={styles}>
    <h1>Nivo basic demo</h1>
    <div style={{ height: "400px" }}>
      <ResponsiveBar data={data} keys={["earnings"]} indexBy="quarter" />
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

Least amount of effort\! You render a `<ResponsiveBar>` component, give
it data and some params, and Nivo handles the rest.

Wonderful\! But means you have to learn a whole new language of configs
and props that might make your hair stand on end. The documentation is
great and shows how everything works, but I found it difficult to know
which prop combinations are valid.
