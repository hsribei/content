# When should you use an existing library? Which one?

The quickest way to achieve the benefits of integrating React with D3 is
to use a library. A collection of components with pre-built charting
visualizations. Plug it into your app, move on with life.

Great option for basic charts. I recommend it dearly to anyone who comes
to me and asks about building stuff. Try a library first. If it fits
your needs, perfect\! You just saved yourselves plenty of time.

Where libraries become a problem is when you want to move beyond the
library authorâ€™s idea of How Things Are Done. Custom features,
visualizations that arenâ€™t just charts, disabling this or that default
behavior â€¦ it gets messy.

Thatâ€™s why I rarely use libraries myself. Often find it quicker to build
something specific from scratch than figuring out how to hold a
generalized API just right.

But theyâ€™re a great first step. Hereâ€™s a few of the most popular React &
D3 libraries ðŸ‘‡

because itâ€™s a good list.
