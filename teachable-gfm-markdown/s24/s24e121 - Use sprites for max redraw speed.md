### Using sprites for max redraw speed

Our [SVG-based Particles](#svg-particles) component was simple. Iterate
through a list of particles, render a `<Particle>` component for each.

Weâ€™re going to completely rewrite that. Our new approach goes like this:

0.  Cache a sprite on `componentDidMount`
1.  Clear canvas
2.  Redraw all particles
3.  Repeat

Because the new approach renders a flat image, and because we donâ€™t care
about interaction with individual particles, we can get rid of the
`Particle` component. The unnecessary layer of nesting was slowing us
down.

The new `Particles` component looks like this:

``` javascript
// src/components/Particles.jsx

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { FastLayer } from 'react-konva';

class Particles extends Component {
    layerRef = React.createRef();
    
    componentDidMount() {
        this.canvas = this.layerRef.current.canvas._canvas;
        this.canvasContext = this.canvas.getContext('2d');

        this.sprite = new Image();
        this.sprite.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/m5l6lhr.png';
    }

    drawParticle(particle) {
        let { x, y } = particle;

        this.canvasContext.drawImage(this.sprite, 0, 0, 128, 128, x, y, 15, 15);
    }

    componentDidUpdate() {
        let particles = this.props.particles;

        console.time('drawing');
        this.canvasContext.clearRect(0, 0, this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height);

        for (let i = 0; i < particles.length; i++) {
            this.drawParticle(particles[i]);
        }
        console.timeEnd('drawing');
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <FastLayer ref={this.layerRef} listening="false" />
        );
    }
}

export default Particles;
```

40 lines of code is a lot all at once. Letâ€™s walk through step by step.

#### componentDidMount

``` javascript
// src/components/Particles.jsx

// ...
componentDidMount() {
    this.canvas = this.refs.layer.canvas._canvas;
    this.canvasContext = this.canvas.getContext('2d');

    this.sprite = new Image();
    this.sprite.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/m5l6lhr.png';
}
```

React calls `componentDidMount` when our component first renders. We use
it to set up 3 instance properties.

`this.canvas` is a reference to the HTML5 Canvas element. We get it
through a ref to the Konva layer, then spelunk through Konva internals
to get the canvas itself. As the `_` prefix indicates, Anton Lavrenov
did not intend this to be a public API.

Thanks to JavaScriptâ€™s permissiveness, we can use it anyway. ðŸ™Œ

`this.canvasContext` is a reference to our canvasâ€™s
[CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D).
Itâ€™s the interface we use to draw basic shapes, perform transformations,
and so on. Context is the only part of canvas you ever interact with as
a developer.

Why itâ€™s not just Canvas, I donâ€™t know.

`this.sprite` is a cached image. A small minion that we are going to
copy-paste all over as our particle. Creating a new image object with
`new Image()` and setting the `src` property downloads our sprite from
the internet into browser memory.

It looks like this:

You might think itâ€™s unsafe to copy references to rendered elements into
component properties like that, but itâ€™s okay. Our render function
always renders the same thing, so the reference never changes. It just
makes our code cleaner.

Should our component unmount and re-mount, React will call
`componentDidMount` again and update our reference.

#### drawParticle

``` javascript
// src/components/Particles.jsx

// ...
drawParticle(particle) {
    let { x, y } = particle;

    this.canvasContext.drawImage(this.sprite, 0, 0, 128, 128, x, y, 15, 15);
}
```

`drawParticle` draws a single particle on the canvas. It gets
coordinates from the `particle` argument and uses `drawImage` to copy
our sprite into position.

We use the whole sprite, corner `(0, 0)` to corner `(128, 128)`. Thatâ€™s
how big our sprite is. And we copy it to position `(x, y)` with a width
and height of `15` pixels.

`drawImage` is the fastest method Iâ€™ve found to put pixels on canvas. I
donâ€™t know why itâ€™s so fast, but hereâ€™s a [helpful
benchmark](https://jsperf.com/canvas-drawimage-vs-putimagedata/3) so you
can see for yourself.

#### componentDidUpdate

``` javascript
// src/components/Particles.jsx

// ...
componentDidUpdate() {
    let particles = this.props.particles;

    console.time('drawing');
    this.canvasContext.clearRect(0, 0, this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height);

    for (let i = 0; i < particles.length; i++) {
        this.drawParticle(particles[i]);
    }
    console.timeEnd('drawing');
}
```

`componentDidUpdate` is where the magic happens. React calls this
lifecycle method every time our list of particles changes. *After* the
`render` method.

Just like the D3 blackbox approach, we move rendering out of the
`render` method and into `componentDidUpdate`.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

1.  `this.canvasContext.clearRect` clears the entire canvas from
    coordinate `(0, 0)` to coordinate `(width, height)`. We delete
    everything and make the canvas transparent.
2.  We iterate our `particles` list with a `for` loop and call
    `drawParticle` on each element.

Clearing and redrawing the canvas is faster than moving individual
particles. For loops are faster than `.map` or any other form of
iteration. I tested. A lot.

Open your browser console and see how long each frame takes to draw. The
`console.time` - `console.timeEnd` pair measures how long it takes your
code to get from `time` to `timeEnd`. You can have as many of these
timers running as you want as long as you give them different names.

#### render

``` javascript
// src/components/Particles.jsx

// ...
render() {
    return (
        <FastLayer ref={this.layerRef} listening="false" />
    );
}
```

After all that work, our `render` method is quite short.

We render a Konva `FastLayer`, give it a `ref`Â and turn off `listening`
for mouse events. That makes the fast layer even faster.

Ideas for this combination of settings came from Konvaâ€™s official
[performance
tips](https://konvajs.github.io/docs/performance/All_Performance_Tips.html)
documentation. This makes sense when you think about it.

A `FastLayer` is faster than a `Layer`. Itâ€™s in the name. Ignoring mouse
events means you donâ€™t have to keep track of elements. It reduces
computation.

This was empirically the fastest solution with the most particles on
screen.
