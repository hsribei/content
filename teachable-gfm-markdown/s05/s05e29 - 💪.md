# You‚Äôre awesome

You know the basics\!

You can take any D3 example from the internets and wrap it in a React
component, *and* you know how to build React+D3 components from scratch.
You‚Äôre amazing. High five\! üñê

The rest of this book is about using these concepts and pushing them to
the limits of practicality. We‚Äôre going to build an interactive
visualization of tech salaries compared to median household income.

Why? Because it piqued my interest, and because it shows why you should
call yourself an engineer, not a programmer or a developer. **You‚Äôre an
engineer**. Remember that.

Throughout the example, you‚Äôll learn more details of D3, tidbits from
React, and the animation chapter is going to blow your mind.

Super fun\!
