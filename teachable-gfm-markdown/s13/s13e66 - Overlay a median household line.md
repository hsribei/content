## Overlay a median household line

Here’s a more interesting component: the median dotted line. It shows a
direct comparison between the histogram’s distribution and the median
household income in an area. I’m not sure people understand it at a
glance, but I think it’s cool.

We’re using a quick approach where everything fits into a functional
React component. It’s great for small components like this.

### Step 1: App.js

Inside `src/App.js`, we first have to add an import, then extract the
median household value from state, and in the end, add `MedianLine` to
the render method.

Let’s see if we can do it in a single code block :smile:

    // src/App.js
    import Histogram from './components/Histogram';
    import { Title, Description, GraphDescription } from './components/Meta';
    // markua-start-insert
    import MedianLine from './components/MedianLine';
    // markua-end-insert
    
    class App extends Component {
        // ...
        render() {
            // ...
            let zoom = null,
                // markua-start-insert
                medianHousehold = this.state.medianIncomesByUSState['US'][0]
                                      .medianIncome;
                // markua-end-insert
    
            return (
                // ...
                <svg width="1100" height="500">
                    <CountyMap // ... />
                    <Histogram // ... />
                    // markua-start-insert
                    <MedianLine data={filteredSalaries}
                                x={500}
                                y={10}
                                width={600}
                                height={500}
                                bottomMargin={5}
                                median={medianHousehold}
                                value={d => d.base_salary} />
                    // markua-end-insert
                </svg>
            )
        }
    }

You probably don’t remember `medianIncomesByUSState` anymore. We set it
up way back when [tying datasets together](#tie-datasets-together). It
groups our salary data by US state.

See, using good names helps :smile:

When rendering `MedianLine`, we give it sizing and positioning props,
the dataset, a `value` accessor, and the median value to show. We could
make it smart enough to calculate the median, but the added flexibility
of a prop felt right.

### Step 2: MedianLine

The `MedianLine` component looks similar to what you’ve seen so far.
Some imports, a `constructor` that sets up D3 objects, an `updateD3`
method that keeps them in sync, and a `render` method that outputs SVG.

{ format: javascript, line-numbers: false, caption: “MedianLine
component stub”}

    // src/components/MedianLine.js
    
    import React from "react";
    import * as d3 from "d3";
    
    const MedianLine = ({
        data,
        value,
        width,
        height,
        x,
        y,
        bottomMargin,
        median
    }) => {
    
    };
    
    export default MedianLine;

We have some imports, a functional `MedianLine` component that takes our
props, and an export. It should cause an error because it’s not
returning anything.

Everything we need to render the line, fits into this function.

{format: javascript, line-numbers: false, caption: “MedianLine render”}

    // src/components/MedianLine.js
    
    const MedianLine = ({
        // ...
    }) => {
        const yScale = d3
                .scaleLinear()
                .domain([0, d3.max(data, value)])
                .range([height - y - bottomMargin, 0]),
            line = d3.line()([[0, 5], [width, 5]]);
    
        const medianValue = median || d3.median(data, value);
    
        const translate = `translate(${x}, ${yScale(medianValue)})`,
            medianLabel = `Median Household: $${yScale.tickFormat()(median)}`;
    
        return (
            <g className="mean" transform={translate}>
                <text
                    x={width - 5}
                    y="0"
                    textAnchor="end"
                    style={{ background: "purple" }}
                >
                    {medianLabel}
                </text>
                <path d={line} />
            </g>
        );
    };

We start with a scale for vertical positioning – `yScale`. It’s linear,
takes values from `0` to `max`, and translates them to pixels less some
margin. For the `medianValue`, we use props, or calculate our own, if
needed. Just like I promised.

A `translate` SVG transform helps us position our line and label. We use
it all to return a `<g>` grouping element containing a `<text>` for our
label, and a `<path>` for the line.

Building the `d` attribute for the path, that’s interesting. We use a
`line` generator from D3.

{caption: “Line generator”, line-numbers: false}

``` javascript
line = d3.line()([[0, 5], [width, 5]]);
```

It comes from the [d3-shape](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#lines)
package and generates splines, or polylines. By default, it takes an
array of points and builds a line through all of them. A line from
`[0, 5]` to `[width, 5]` in our case.

That makes it span the entire width and leaves 5px for the label. We’re
using a `transform` on the entire group to vertically position the final
element.

Remember, we already styled `medianLine` when we built [histogram
styles](#histogram-css) earlier.

{caption: “Histogram css”, line-numbers: false}

``` css
.mean text {
  font: 11px sans-serif;
  fill: grey;
}

.mean path {
  stroke-dasharray: 3;
  stroke: grey;
  stroke-width: 1px;
}
```

The `stroke-dasharray` is what makes it dashed. `3` means each `3px`
dash is followed by a `3px` blank. You can use [any pattern you
like](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-dasharray).

You should see a median household salary line overlaid on your
histogram.

Almost everyone in tech makes more than an entire median household.
Crazy, huh? I think it is.

If that didn’t work, consult the [diff on
Github](https://github.com/Swizec/react-d3js-step-by-step/commit/1fd055e461184fb8dc8dd509edb3a6a683c995fe).
