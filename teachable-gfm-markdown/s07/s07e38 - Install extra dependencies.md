## Install dependencies for React for Datavisualization

There are a couple of libraries we’re going to use often in this book:
D3, Topojson, and Lodash. We’re using D3 to do our heavy lifting,
Topojson to parse geographical data, and Lodash to make data
manipulation easier.

You can install them like this:

    $ npm install --save d3 topojson lodash

Additionally, we’re using Bootstrap for default styling and String for
string manipulation. You should install them as well.

    $ npm install --save bootstrap string

Now your environment is ready\! You should see a default React App page
in the browser without errors. Keep `npm start` running as you follow
the examples in this book.

Some examples are going to need other libraries. When that happens, I’ll
remind you to install them.
