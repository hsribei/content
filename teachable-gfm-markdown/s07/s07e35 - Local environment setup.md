# Set up a local environment with create-react-app

Can you believe this is the third time I’m writing a *“How to set up all
the tools and get started”* section? The ecosystem moves fast\!

You can see the old versions as [Appendix A](#appendixA) – a
roll-your-own environment that’s almost the same as the one I’m about to
show you, and [Appendix B](#appendixB) – a browserify-based environment
(if you don’t like Webpack).

In the summer of 2016, the React team released a tool called
`create-react-app`. It creates a React app so that you can get started
right away. All of the code in this book runs with an app set up like
this.

Getting started with React has never been easier.

1.  Make sure you have node.js
2.  Install the app generator
3.  Run the app generator
